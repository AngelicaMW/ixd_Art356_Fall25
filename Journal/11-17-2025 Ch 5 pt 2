#Chapter 5 Part 2


I really liked the concept of "..Jidoka, which Toyota says is “'roughly translated
as ‘automation with a human touch.’(page 192)” Where they force employees not to be afraid of causing a complete stop in the process,
in the name of protection for the consumer. Too little companies actually consider the consumer nowadays, they only consider innovation.
However, is it really innovation if the consumer considers the design a step backwards? I heavilly disagree with Teslas, for example, or any modern car that
has a screen instead of buttons and knobs. Interesting and sleek design? Sure! But because there is no tactile feedback to tell the
consumer what screen they are on..they will need to keep looking at the screen and take their hands off the wheel. That seems counter
intuitive, no? How is playing with a screen while driving supposed to be safer?

Also, I was particularly interested in the discussion of page 210 referring to sleep-deprivation. Funny how the world expects certain expectations when it comes to knowlegde but not bodily function. 
In my mind, the body comes first. If someone is too tired to function, they shoudn't be doing the thing. But today, we see so many go by the 'grindet' mentality that it literally breaks them by running them into the 
ground. Tech is supposed to help us so that these kinds of things can be remedied a bit more. But the more that tech gets involved in the world, it only seems to do more harm than good. At this rate, no design, may be 
thebetter design. I wonder, if one day, we will reach a peak of innovation where we all finally realize that it's all bad. Then we just take huge steps backwards, and ironically, in the right direction again.
