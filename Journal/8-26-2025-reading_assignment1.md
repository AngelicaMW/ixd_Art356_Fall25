# Chp 1 of DOET

After listening to Chapter 1 of The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman, it solidified to me how important the clarity of the design is when its heavily reliant on the human experience. How the user feels using the 
product is sometimes an emotional journey and it's what they are going to remember when discussing the product later. If it made them angry, happy, confused, lost, or even motivated. We know we're getting old when the newest
excitable conversation starter is the vacuum that actually sucks versus just rolling over the particles. A designer can create something that could be super helpful but that help is useless if the person using it cannot 
easily figure out the product. The designer can look at the product they made and know all of its ins and outs, what the color palette means, the thought that went into each shape to differentiate settings. But what of the 
user? Are they simply an afterthought? Is it the user's fault that they didn't know ahead of time how to try out this new product? No, that is simply
poor design. Good design allows the user the comfort to explore and feel in control of the situation and overall satisfied about what they gave their hard earned money to. On this front, I agree with Norman that it is
never the user's fault that they cannot use a product as intended, it is the designer's for not using already clearer design standards/expectations. Like that green means go and red means stop, it's easy, don't go hard 
to be unique and create unnecesssary confusion by trying to make yellow the new green.

I found the differences between signifiers and affordances to be somewhat diffiult to decipher. Yes, a signifier can be a visual label, but when an affordance can be invisible, how broad are those possibilities the user can 
try to go? But I grasped the modern explanation for feedback and mapping quickly enough. With mapping as described on page 23, our mind wants to draw a distinguishable path from point A to point B with no deviation. Feedback,
in my opinion is usually a sensory experience. As described on page 27, the acknowledgement that there is an invisible process happening for the user to wait until it is done. Such as the crosswalk buttons that yell "WAIT" 
for all kinds of users to hear that they should not walk just yet.
